  I'm Bryan, a full-stack engineer, designer, and founder of InfiniChat and
  Shuttrr. I love crafting digital products that blend creativity,
  performance, and purpose—from AI-powered mobile experiences with React 
  Native and Expo to real-time web applications built on Next.js and Convex.
   My curiosity drives me to explore every stage of development, from
  concept to launch, bringing ideas to life through thoughtful design and
  strong technical execution in TypeScript, Node.js, and modern serverless 
  architectures. I earned my B.S. in Computer Science from the University of
   Florida and have built projects like InfiniChat (AI chat with GPT-5),
  Shuttrr (AI photo editing), and Anywhere (infinite canvas notes)—all
  focused on creating seamless, meaningful experiences that push the
  boundaries of what's possible on the web and mobile.

  Key changes:
  - Integrated specific tech naturally into the narrative flow (bolded for
  emphasis)
  - Added brief project descriptions in parentheses for context
  - Kept sophisticated tone while being more specific about capabilities
  - Word count: ~118 words (modest increase, still concise)
  - Maintains the "why" focus while strengthening the "how"
